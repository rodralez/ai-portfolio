## JurisGPT: an AI-powered Retrieval QA System for the Supreme Court Rulings of the province of Mendoza, Argentina

The project aims to develop an MVP retrieval question-answering system that utilizes the rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice of the province of Mendoza as a document corpus. Users will have the capability to ask questions based on the court's jurisprudence. The system employs several technologies such as LangChain, LLM Vicuna 13B, and Chroma DB, among others, and will be deployed on the AWS cloud. This comprehensive solution will enable efficient and accurate retrieval of information from the court's rulings, enhancing access to legal knowledge.

One of the main challenges of the project are:

1. Processing documents in Spanish: The LLM models will be assessed based on their ability to process documents in Spanish effectively.
2. Fine-tuning the LLM for Spanish legal vocabulary: A crucial task involves adapting the LLM to accurately handle the specific legal terminology in Spanish.

## R Shiny Application for Gene Symbol and GO Term Search

The R Shiny application efficiently addresses the following tasks:

1. Users can enter a gene symbol or a GO term in the input box.
2. Autocomplete results are displayed as the user types.
3. If a gene symbol is selected, the application shows its corresponding gene symbol, gene synonyms, Ensembl ID, and associated GO terms.
4. If a GO term is selected, the application displays the genes associated with it. For each gene, it shows the gene symbol, gene synonyms, Ensembl ID, and relevant GO terms.

You have two options to run this application:

1. Execute the `app.R` file using RStudio.
2. Visit [https://rodralez.shinyapps.io/gene-app/](https://rodralez.shinyapps.io/gene-app/) to access the application online.

Technologies used: R, Shiny App.
