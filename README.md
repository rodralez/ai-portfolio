## Projects

### Data Science Challenge

In this Data Science Challenge, two task were addressed:

1. Task 1: Understand the data and prepare the pipeline to transform the data from the raw format to the requested form. 

2. Task 2: The goal of this task is to solve business case involving the development of the analytical model using the provided data.
