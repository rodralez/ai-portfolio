This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(shiny)
library(DT)
library(dplyr)

# Read the data from the CSV file
rawdata <- read.csv("../../../rawdata/Homo+sapiens.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

glimpse(rawdata)
data  <- rawdata %>% select(gene_symbol, go_term_id, gene_synonyms, ensembl_transcript_id)

gene_table <- data.frame(symbol = rawdata$gene_symbol, synonyms = rawdata$gene_synonyms, transcript = rawdata$ensembl_transcript_id)
go_table <- data.frame(id = rawdata$go_term_id)

# write.csv2(data, "genes_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
