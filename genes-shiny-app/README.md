## R Shiny Application for Gene Symbol and GO Term Search

The R Shiny application efficiently addresses the following tasks:

1. Users can enter a gene symbol or a GO term in the input box.
2. Autocomplete results are displayed as the user types.
3. If a gene symbol is selected, the application shows its corresponding gene symbol, gene synonyms, Ensembl ID, and associated GO terms.
4. If a GO term is selected, the application displays the genes associated with it. For each gene, it shows the gene symbol, gene synonyms, Ensembl ID, and relevant GO terms.

You have two options to run this application:

1. Execute the `app.R` file using RStudio.
2. Visit [https://rodralez.shinyapps.io/gene-app/](https://rodralez.shinyapps.io/gene-app/) to access the application online.
