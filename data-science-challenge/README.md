# Data Science Challenge

In this Data Science Challenge, two task were addressed:

## Task 1 

Understand the data and prepare the pipeline to transform the data from the raw format to the requested form. 

## Task 2 

The goal of this task is to solve business case involving the development of the analytical model using the provided data.

### Business case

Company "Baby Potato" manufactures packaged baked potato and aims to produce the product with *optimal* color, while keeping the raw materials waste at *minimum*. 

Your task as a data scientist, is to solve this problem using machine learning/modeling techniques and report your findings on how to improve the product color and reduce the waste to the *Head of production* of Baby Potato.

### Final presentation
